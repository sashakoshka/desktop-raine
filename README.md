![Raine!](img/1.png)

Raine from TwoKinds, right on your desktop! Made using C and SDL2. Currently in very early development.

## Build instructions:
* `make` - gives you a binary called "raine"
* `make run` - builds and runs raine
* `make clean` - removes the binary
* `make install` - imbue your system with raine

Windows compatibility coming soon.
